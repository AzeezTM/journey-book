<h2 align="center">A front-end developer from Nigeria</h2>

- I am Mubarak, from Nigeria, I am a front-end developer, A Wildlife Conservationist and an Ecotourist.

- I like to tour, I have travelled and visited most of the tourist sites in southwestern Nigeria.

- I am currently learning some programming languages so that I will use it to build projects that will be useful in conserving wildlife and to create innovative travel software solutions.

## My Journey
- I started coding this January, 2022 where I learnt how to code at SQI College of ICT, Ibadan, Nigeria.

- I was taught HTML, CSS, Bootstrap within two months which i designed some projects within the two months.

- I also learnt JavaScript for two months which I also work on some projects like Picture Puzzle Game, Alarm, Calculator, To-do List. I was given a picture puzzle game as my JavaScript project which I presented. I used drag and drop API to make the picture draggable but I am currently working on the last part, I want a modal to display once the player is able to complete the game.

- I just finish learning React-js and I have built a Banking App(https://github.com/AzeezTM/Banking_App) and I'm currently learning Typescript.

- I am currently looking for an internship to get more experience as a Software Developer
